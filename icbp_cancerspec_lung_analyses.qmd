###  Table 1. Sample description (by jurisdiction, sex, age group, stage group, diagnosis year)

#| label: the_table1
#| echo: false
#| results: asis

readRDS("results/table1.RDS")

### Table 2. Distribution of stage at diagnosis for lung cancer in jurisdictions using TNM (A) or SEER (B) stage*

#### A

```{r}
#| label: analysis1a_table
#| echo: false
#| results: asis

readRDS("results/table2A_TNM.RDS")

#### Table 3. Pooled estimates and 95% prediction intervals for the proportion of lung cancer patients who receive chemotherapy or radiotherapy, both for all patients and for those with recorded stage 1-3 or stage 4 cancer.

```{r}
#| label: meta_table
#| echo: false
#| results: asis

### Figure 1. Proportion of lung cancer patients in each jurisdiction who received chemotherapy (top) or radiotherapy (bottom) treatment, both overall (left), and for stages 1-3 or localised-regional (middle), or stage 4 or distant (right). Grey diamonds show the pooled estimate from a random-effects meta-analysis, with the widest point being the central estimate, the edges of the diamond representing 95% confidence intervals, and the wider grey lines representing 95% prediction intervals.

### Figure 2. Proportion of patients treated with chemotherapy (top) and radiotherapy (bottom) by age, for all stages (left), non-advanced stage (middle), and advanced stage (right). Coloured lines show jurisdictional results. Dashed lines show 95% CIs. Grey lines show results for all other jurisdictions for ease of comparisons.

### Figure 3. Proportion of patients treated with chemotherapy (top) and radiotherapy (bottom), by sex

### Figure 4. Cumulative   percent of patients in each country who had received chemotherapy or radiotherapy treatment, by elapsed time since diagnosis, for all stages, stages 1-3 (or localised/regional), or stage 4 (or distant).
Stage-specific results for Australia are based on New South Wales only.

### Figure 5 (A-left, B-right). Scatter plot of jurisdictional use of surgery vs chemotherapy and radiotherapy for a subset of jurisdictions. Circles show jurisdiction-specific use, all lung cancer patients. Data relating to surgery use do not always align to study period for chemotherapy or radiotherapy use, or population basis (see footnote). Pearson’s r for surgery vs chemotherapy = 0.75 (95% CI -0.15, 0.97); Pearson’s r for surgery vs chemotherapy = 0.60 (-0.42, 0.95)

### Figure 6. Scatter plot of jurisdictional use of radiotherapy vs chemotherapy, for all stages, stages 1-3 (or localised/regional), or stage 4 (or distant).

### Figure 7. Scatter plot of jurisdictional five-year net survival against use of chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery.
